# Ada Deep Learning Library

Welcome to the **Ada Deep Learning Library**! This project provides a foundational deep learning library built in the Ada programming language. This README will guide you through setting up the library, compiling the code, and running the main application, demos, and tests.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Alire** installed, as it is the package manager used for this project. Alire helps manage all required dependencies to build and run the library.

## Update Dependencies

To update all the required dependencies for the project, run:

```bash
alr update
```

## Build the Project

To compile the Ada source files, run:

```bash
alr build
```

This command compiles the source code and prepares the binaries for running the main application, demo, and tests.

## Running the Applications

### Main Application

To run the core component of the Ada Deep Learning Library, use:

```bash
./bin/mlengine-main.exe
```

### Demo Application

To see a demonstration of the deep learning capabilities, run the demo application:

```bash
./bin/mlengine_demo
```

### Test Application

To verify that everything is working as expected, run the test suite:

```bash
./bin/test.exe
```
